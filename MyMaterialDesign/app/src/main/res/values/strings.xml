    <string name="collapse_content">Design is the art of continuous problem solving—an active cycle of investigating and validating needs, crafting and developing ideas, and creating solutions. Over the course of its life, a digital product is shaped by many hands. The effects of this collaboration can be seen in the quality of a product’s identity and implementation, as well as in the strength of the community it builds.We created Material Design as a metaphor to rationalize design and implementation, establishing a shared language to help teams unite style, branding, interaction, and motion under a cohesive set of principles.We believe a better design process yields better products, which is why we’re expanding Material to be a system that supports the principles of good design and strengthens communication and productivity with new tools and inspiration. We hope these resources will help teams realize their greatest design potential, and we’re eager to see the results.Design is the art of continuous problem solving—an active cycle of investigating and validating needs, crafting and developing ideas, and creating solutions.
